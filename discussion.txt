Usecase 1 - if the user asks question like - which is my most urgent task

Solution 1 -

For a question like "Which is my most urgent task?", the Analytics Agent should handle it, with the Supervisor Agent orchestrating the flow. Here's the process that would occur:

Supervisor Agent receives the user query "Which is my most urgent task?"
Supervisor Agent identifies this as a query about task priorities and analytics
Supervisor Agent routes the query to the Analytics Agent
Analytics Agent performs these actions:

Analyzes the current task inventory
Evaluates urgency based on multiple factors:

Explicit deadlines
Priority settings
Dependencies with other tasks
Historical completion patterns
Current progress status


Identifies the most urgent task based on this analysis
Formats the information in a user-friendly way


Analytics Agent returns the analysis to the Supervisor Agent
Supervisor Agent provides the final response to the user

The Analytics Agent is best suited for this query because:

It specializes in analyzing task data and extracting insights
It has access to the full task history and status information
It can apply sophisticated urgency algorithms that consider multiple factors
It can provide context about why a particular task is deemed most urgent

While the Planning Agent handles initial task prioritization during task creation and breakdown, the Analytics Agent is responsible for analyzing the current state of all tasks and providing insights based on that analysis. This includes identifying which tasks are most urgent at any given moment.
The response could include not just which task is most urgent, but also contextual information like:

Why this task is considered urgent
When it needs to be completed
What consequences might occur if delayed
How it relates to other pending tasks

This division of responsibilities maintains clear boundaries between agents while ensuring the user gets comprehensive information about their task priorities.Retry

Usecase 2 - if the user asks question like - reschedule "buy fruits" task to tomorrow

Solution 2 -

For a request like "Reschedule 'buy fruits' task to tomorrow," the Adaptation Agent should handle it, with the Supervisor Agent orchestrating the flow. Here's how the process would work:

Supervisor Agent receives the user request "Reschedule 'buy fruits' task to tomorrow"
Supervisor Agent identifies this as a task modification/adaptation request
Supervisor Agent routes the request to the Adaptation Agent
Adaptation Agent performs these actions:

Locates the "buy fruits" task in the system state
Validates that rescheduling is possible (no critical dependencies affected)
Determines the appropriate "tomorrow" date based on current context
Updates the task's scheduled date
Checks for any ripple effects on dependent tasks
Potentially adjusts any affected execution plans
Records this adaptation in the task history


Adaptation Agent returns the updated task information to the Supervisor Agent
Supervisor Agent provides confirmation to the user

The Adaptation Agent is best suited for this request because:

It specializes in modifying existing plans and task parameters
It's designed to handle schedule adjustments while maintaining plan coherence
It can evaluate the implications of timeline changes on overall task management
It maintains a record of adaptations to improve future planning

While the Planning Agent handles initial scheduling, the Adaptation Agent is specifically responsible for handling changes to existing plans. This clear separation ensures that:

The system maintains a record of plan changes
Adaptations are handled consistently
Dependencies and side effects are properly considered
The user's shifting priorities are accommodated without disrupting the overall system

The response would likely include confirmation of the rescheduling, possibly with additional context such as:

Confirmation of the new date
Any effects on related tasks
Suggestions for optimal timing tomorrow
Updated reminders if applicable

This approach maintains the integrity of specialized agent responsibilities while providing seamless task management for the user.Retry

Usecase 3 - if the user asks question like - refine "apply OCI card" task
where user wants agent to add description, tags, priority, due date, and other metadata

Solution 3 -

For a request like "Refine 'apply OCI card' task" where the user wants to add description, tags, priority, due date, and other metadata, the Task Creation Agent should handle it, with the Supervisor Agent orchestrating the flow. Here's how the process would work:

Supervisor Agent receives the user request "Refine 'apply OCI card' task"
Supervisor Agent identifies this as a task metadata enhancement request
Supervisor Agent routes the request to the Task Creation Agent
Task Creation Agent performs these actions:

Retrieves the existing "apply OCI card" task from the system state
Engages with the user to collect additional metadata through targeted questions
Extracts implicit information from user responses
May research what an "OCI card" is to suggest appropriate metadata
Enriches the task with enhanced description, tags, priority, due date
May suggest additional relevant metadata based on similar past tasks
Formats the enriched task object according to system requirements


Task Creation Agent returns the enriched task to the Supervisor Agent
Supervisor Agent may then route to the Planning Agent if the enriched metadata warrants task breakdown updates
Supervisor Agent provides confirmation of the refinements to the user

The Task Creation Agent is best suited for this request because:

It specializes in task metadata extraction and enrichment
It's specifically designed to convert unstructured information into structured task data
It has natural language understanding capabilities to parse and suggest metadata
It maintains consistency in how tasks are formatted within the system

While this involves modifying an existing task rather than creating a new one, the Task Creation Agent still handles it because:

The fundamental operation is enriching metadata, which is the Task Creation Agent's core expertise
The task needs to be reformatted with new information, which falls under task formation
The initial metadata extraction process is the same as for new task creation

The response would likely include confirmation of all added metadata, and potentially:

Suggestions for further refinements
Recommended subtasks based on the enriched description
Questions to gather any missing critical information
Explanation of how the added metadata will help with task completion

This approach ensures that all task metadata is handled consistently regardless of when it's added to the system, while maintaining clear agent specialization.RetrySSif the user asks create a task like - "do yoga"
and if they have selected Anne le cunff as their coach, anne promotes "tiny experiments" approach to run a personal experiment using a pact—a time-bound commitment to a repeatable action that follows this format: I will [action] for [duration]. “The pact is the fundamental building block of personal experimentation, a self-invitation to try something new and learn from the experience. It’s a call to escape inertia and live in forward motion. What makes a pact so effective is that it focuses on your outputs (e.g., “publish 25 newsletters over the next 25 weeks”) rather than your outcomes (e.g. “get 5,000 newsletter subscribers in 25 weeks”). It gives you the confidence to get started because there is no bad result or wrong choice. You just need to show up.”
Excerpt From
Tiny Experiments
Anne-Laure Le Cunff
This material may be protected by copyright.“Just like the protocol of a scientific experiment, a pact is based on instructions that are clear and contained. That’s why “I will learn how to code” is a flawed pact, but “I will code every day for a hundred days” is a great one. Instead of “I will write a book,” try “I will write every weekday for the next six months.” Replace “I will run a marathon” with “I will run every Sunday for six weeks.” The format of the pact provides a simple mechanism to commit to action, a way to rely on momentum instead of motivation. You just need to get started and trust that you will naturally build confidence through repetition.”

Anne-Laure Le Cunffhow and which agents should handle it?EditFor creating a task like "do yoga" with Anne-Laure Le Cunff as the selected coach promoting her "tiny experiments" approach, this would involve multiple agents working in sequence. Here's how the process would flow:

Supervisor Agent receives the user request to create a "do yoga" task with Anne Le Cunff as coach
Supervisor Agent identifies this as a task creation request with a specific coaching methodology
The request would flow through these agents:

First: Task Creation Agent

Receives the initial "do yoga" request
Recognizes Anne Le Cunff as the selected coach
Creates the basic task object with initial metadata
Flags that this task should follow the "tiny experiments" coaching methodology
Passes the created task to the Supervisor

Next: Planning Agent

Receives the task from the Supervisor
Applies Anne Le Cunff's "tiny experiments" framework to structure the task
Transforms "do yoga" into a proper pact format: "I will practice yoga for [suggested duration]"
Suggests specific parameters:

Time-bound commitment (e.g., "for 15 minutes daily for the next 21 days")
Focus on output-based metrics rather than outcome-based
Clear, repeatable action structure


Creates subtasks that align with the tiny experiments methodology
Returns the structured plan to the Supervisor

Finally: Execution Coach Agent

Receives the structured plan from the Supervisor
Personalizes coaching messages using Anne Le Cunff's voice and methodology
Prepares motivation and guidance that emphasizes:

The importance of showing up consistently
Focusing on the action rather than results
Building momentum through repetition
The experimental mindset (no "wrong" results)


Sets up appropriate check-ins to maintain the pact
Returns the coaching strategy to the Supervisor

A mechanism for the Execution Coach Agent to adopt the selected coach's voice and methodology when providing guidance.

The final user experience would transform a simple "do yoga" request into a structured tiny experiment like:

Task Created: "I will practice yoga for 15 minutes each morning for the next 21 days"
Coach Anne says: "Remember, this tiny experiment isn't about becoming an expert yogi or achieving perfect flexibility. It's about showing up consistently for your practice. The power is in the repetition – just 15 minutes each morning. There's no failing this experiment as long as you stick to your pact. What simple prop or reminder can you place by your bed to trigger your morning yoga ritual?"

This multi-agent approach ensures the task follows Anne's methodology while maintaining the specialized responsibilities of each agent in the system.Retry

usecase 4 - if the user asks a questions like - "i feel anxious, what to do?"

Solution 4 - 

For a query like "I feel anxious, what to do?", this is a sensitive, wellbeing-related request that requires thoughtful handling. Here's how the system should respond:
Agent Flow

Supervisor Agent receives the user query "I feel anxious, what to do?"
Supervisor Agent identifies this as an emotional wellbeing concern rather than a standard task management request
Supervisor Agent routes this primarily to the Execution Coach Agent with input from other agents

Primary: Execution Coach Agent
The Execution Coach Agent should take the lead because:

It's designed to provide supportive guidance
It has access to user's psychological profile
It can deliver empathetic responses
It's equipped with wellbeing intervention strategies

The Execution Coach Agent would:

Acknowledge the user's anxiety with empathy
Offer immediate, accessible coping strategies
Present options rather than directives
Use a warm, supportive tone
Suggest light, low-pressure activities to help regulate emotions

Support: Analytics Agent
The Analytics Agent could provide:

Information about what activities have helped the user feel better in the past
Patterns of when anxiety tends to occur
What strategies have been most effective historically

Support: Planning Agent
The Planning Agent could:

Suggest simple, optional "anxiety management" tasks
Ensure these are framed as supportive tools, not obligations
Create very small, achievable steps

Response Approach
The system should NOT:

Create mandatory tasks when someone is expressing emotional distress
Suggest the user "just get over it" or "push through"
Overload them with complex techniques
Minimize their feelings

Instead, the response should:

Validate their feelings: "It's completely understandable to feel anxious sometimes."
Offer immediate coping options (breathing exercises, gentle movement, etc.)
Suggest optional light activities that could help:

A 5-minute breathing exercise
A short walk outside
A brief journaling prompt
A simple grounding technique


Frame any task suggestions as optional support tools, not as obligations:

"Would you like me to create a gentle self-care activity for today?"
"I can suggest a few small practices that might help ease anxiety. Would that be helpful?"


Include a compassionate reminder: "Remember that it's okay to just rest if that's what you need right now."

Example Response
The Supervisor Agent would synthesize input from the specialized agents into something like:
"I understand you're feeling anxious right now. That's a completely valid feeling, and I appreciate you sharing it.
Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise? Taking 5 slow breaths, inhaling for 4 counts and exhaling for 6, can help activate your parasympathetic nervous system.
From what I've noticed, gentle movement has helped you feel more grounded in the past. Would you like me to add an optional 10-minute walk to your day? No pressure to complete it - it's just there as a supportive tool if you feel up to it.
Sometimes anxiety can feel overwhelming. Remember that taking care of yourself is important, and it's perfectly okay to adjust your tasks for today if you need to."
