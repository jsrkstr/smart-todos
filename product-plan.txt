SmartTodos is an app that helps people complete the tasks that they have set for themselves.
This app tries to resolve several key psychological and practical reasons why many people struggle to complete their to-do lists and personal goals:Challenges for User - 
* Emotional Regulation Challenges
    * Emotional states significantly impact goal pursuit. Stress, anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem can derail even the most well-intentioned plans.
* Lack of Adaptive Strategy
    * Successful goal achievement requires flexibility. People often stick to rigid plans instead of adjusting strategies when initial approaches don't work.
* External Distractions
    * Modern life is filled with constant interruptions: Smartphone notifications, social media, work pressures, family responsibilities, and unexpected life events.
* Insufficient Self-Awareness
    * Many individuals don't truly understand their genuine interests, personal working style, energy patterns throughout the day, and realistic personal limitations.
* Unrealistic Expectations
    * People often set goals based on idealized versions of themselves, disconnected from their current capabilities, resources, and daily constraints. This mismatch creates frustration and eventual abandonment.
* Motivation Burnout
    * Initial enthusiasm often wanes quickly. Without consistent strategies to maintain motivation, people lose momentum. This includes not celebrating small wins, failing to create accountability, and lacking a compelling emotional connection to the goal.
* Poor Time Management
    * Many individuals underestimate the time required for tasks, get distracted easily, lack effective prioritization skills, struggle with time blocking and scheduling, and don't allocate sufficient focused time for important goals.
* Psychological Barriers
    * Several mental obstacles prevent goal completion: Fear of failure, perfectionism, low self-efficacy (belief in one's ability to succeed), lack of intrinsic motivation, and negative self-talk and limiting beliefs.
* Lack of Clear Planning
    * Most people create lists without a structured approach. They write down tasks but don't break them into actionable, specific steps. Without a clear roadmap, goals can feel abstract and unattainable. Effective goal-setting requires: Specific, measurable objectives, realistic timelines, incremental milestones, and a systematic approach to tracking progress.
    * It takes time/effort/mental energy to break down a task. Get help from AI.
* Overwhelming Complexity
    * Many people create to-do lists that are too complex or ambitious. They load themselves with too many tasks, which can lead to decision paralysis and procrastination. When goals seem too large or intimidating, individuals often feel demotivated before they even start.

* Send and receive tasks
    * Just like Google meeting invites, request and receive tasks from others. People accept requests and it gets added to their list.
        * Initially, it could be only via email or chat client. Just like in Google invites, once the receiver accepts, they get reminders and progress checks (not adapted to their daily behavior as app not installed), then server sends progress to the sender.
    * Why?
        * Receiver forgets the requests, forgets to tell the requester, but wants to be responsible. Sender forgets the requests, has to follow up with receiver, stressed but doesn't want to annoy the receiver.
* Integration with Other Apps
    * Google Tasks app - Sync tasks
    * Google Calendar - Sync events
